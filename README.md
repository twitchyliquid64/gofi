gofi
============

*A lightweight, raspberry-pi friendly controller for Ubiquity Access Points*

Go-fi is easy to build and deploy, providing basic network management
features with very tiny CPU/Memory/Disk requirements.

What APs do you support?
--------------

This has been tested on UAP-AC-LR and should work on UAP-AC-PRO. No others have been tested but have a reasonable chance of working.

I would be happy to implement / get working any others if you send them my way :)


Is this legal?
--------------

I emailed Ubiquiti and they said they were fine with gofi being publically available, and that they are aware of many similar projects. So go for it!


How do I build?
----------------

First off, make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/twitchyliquid64/gofi
cd gofi
export GOPATH=`pwd`

# A very basic, stateless controller
go build -o statelessController gofi/controllers/stateless
# A slightly less basic, stateful controller
go build -o basicController gofi/controllers/basic
```

How do I run?
---------------

There are two controllers available, statelessController and basicController.

**statelessController**

Stateless controller is super simple, you start it on the command line and it will adopt all APs. You pass in network information on the command line, and it will configure ALL APs to use those. It is stateless, so it will leave the APs with default credentials, and if it is ever restarted re-adopt and reconfigure them.

Usage:

```
Usage of ./statelessController:
  -addr string
    	Controller LAN IP - autodetected if not set
  -enable_5g
    	Make network available on 5G as well as 2.4G (default true)
  -enable_bandsteering
    	Steer clients to 5G network
  -pw string
    	Network password (default "fiog")
  -ssid string
    	Network name (default "gofi")
```

Example:

```./statelessController -enable_5g -enable_bandsteering -ssid "silly_example" -pw "mynetworkpassword"```

**basicController**

Basic controller is identical to statelessController, except it stores the state of the APs in a file, so upon restart it does not need to re-adopt the access points (it has the credentials to continue where it left off). All parameters are the same except you can specify the path to the state file.
If you do not, controllerState.json will be used.

In addition, you can turn on a HTTP server which will serv the last known state for each of your APs. Pass a listener address to turn this on.


Usage:

```
Usage of ./basicController:
  -addr string
    	(optional) Controller LAN IP - autodetected if not set
  -enable_5g
    	Make network available on 5G as well as 2.4G (default true)
  -enable_bandsteering
    	Steer clients to 5G network
  -infoserv string
    	Address to host the infoserv at. Infoserv disabled if not provided.
  -pw string
    	Network password (default "fiog")
  -ssid string
    	Network name (default "gofi")
  -statefile string
    	Path to location to store state
```

Example:

```./basicController -enable_5g -enable_bandsteering -ssid "silly_example" -pw "mynetworkpassword" -infoserv ":8080"```
